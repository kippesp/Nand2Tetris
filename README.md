# NAND to Tetris - Build a Modern Computer from First Principles

My implementation of chapters 1-11 of the NAND to Tetris course.  The final
operating chapter wasn't completed as its fairly uninteresting when compared to
the overall course.

- See MOOC course: https://www.coursera.org/learn/nand2tetris2
- See website: https://www.nand2tetris.org

Requires the addition of the upstream distributions files:

  - nand2tetris/projects
  - nand2tetris/tools/

The two halves of the course are kept in separated branches:

    - part1 - the hardware
    - part2 - the software
